The algorithm builds a search tree, iteratively traverses it, and evaluates its nodes using a Monte-Carlo simulation.\n","\n","In this seminar, we'll implement a MCTS([[1]](#1), [[2]](#2)) planning and use it to solve some Gym envs.\n","\n","![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/6QmwnjPS/image.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t2V_eq49R3_e"},"source":["__How it works?__\n","We just start with an empty tree and expand it. There are several common procedures.\n","\n","__1) Selection__\n","Starting from the root, recursively select the node that corresponds to the tree policy.  \n","\n","There are several options for tree policies, which we saw earlier as exploration strategies: epsilon-greedy, Thomson sampling, UCB-1. It was shown that in MCTS, UCB-1 achieves a good result. Further, we will consider the one, but you can try to use others.\n","\n","Following the UCB-1 tree policy, we will choose an action that, on one hand, we expect to have the highest return, and on the other hand, we haven't explored much.\n","\n","$$\n","\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\argmax}{arg\\,max}\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","\\dot{a} = \\argmax_{a} \\dot{Q}(s, a)\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","\\dot{Q}(s, a) = Q(s, a) + C_p \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log {N}}{n_a}}\n","$$\n","\n","where: \n","- $N$ - number of times we have visited state $s$,\n","- $n_a$ - number of times we have taken action $a$,\n","- $C_p$ - exploration balance parameter, which is performed between exploration and exploitation. \n","\n","Using Hoeffding inequality for rewards $R \\in [0,1]$ it can be shown [[3]](#3) that optimal $C_p = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. For rewards outside this range, the parameter should be tuned. We'll be using 10, but you can experiment with other values.\n","\n","__2) Expansion__\n","After the selection procedure, we can achieve a leaf node or node in which we don't complete actions. In this case, we expand the tree by feasible actions and get new state nodes. \n","\n","__3) Simulation__\n","How we can estimate node Q-values? The idea is to estimate action values for a given _rollout policy_ by averaging the return of many simulated trajectories from the current node. Simply, we can play with random or some special policy or use some model that can estimate it.\n","\n","__4) Backpropagation__\n","The reward of the last simulation is backed up through the traversed nodes and propagates Q-value estimations, upwards to the root.\n","\n","$$\n","Q({\\text{parent}}, a) = r + \\gamma \\cdot Q({\\text{child}}, a)\n","$$\n","\n","There are a lot modifications of MCTS, more details about it you can find in this paper [[4]](#4)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zJLSmSRVR3_f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1626772663068,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":26835,"user":{"displayName":"Valentin Goryachev","photoUrl":"","userId":"06670255808124058379"}},"outputId":"8c0455ae-44b2-4e8f-f4ec-8ee84eeccf1e"},"source":["import sys, os\n","if 'google.colab' in sys.modules and not os.path.exists('.setup_complete'):\n","    !wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/master/setup_colab.sh -O- | bash\n","\n","    !wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/coursera/grading.py -O ../grading.py\n","    !wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/coursera/week6_outro/submit.py\n","\n","    !touch .setup_complete\n","\n","# This code creates a virtual display to draw game images on.\n","# It will have no effect if your machine has a monitor.\n","if type(os.environ.get(\"DISPLAY\")) is not str or len(os.environ.get(\"DISPLAY\")) == 0:\n","    !bash ../xvfb start\n","    os.environ['DISPLAY'] = ':1'"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Selecting previously unselected package xvfb.\n","(Reading database ... 160837 files and directories currently installed.)\n","Preparing to unpack .../xvfb_2%3a1.19.6-1ubuntu4.9_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking xvfb (2:1.19.6-1ubuntu4.9) ...\n","Setting up xvfb (2:1.19.6-1ubuntu4.9) ...\n","Processing triggers for man-db (2.8.3-2ubuntu0.1) ...\n","Starting virtual X frame buffer: Xvfb.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MGNAwZ3CR3_f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1626772663068,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Valentin Goryachev","photoUrl":"","userId":"06670255808124058379"}}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ow01kz-1R3_g"},"source":["---\n","\n","But before we do that, we first need to make a wrapper for Gym environments to allow saving and loading game states to facilitate backtracking."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_-CqEBEuR3_g","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1626772664763,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1697,"user":{"displayName":"Valentin Goryachev","photoUrl":"","userId":"06670255808124058379"}}},"source":["import gym\n","from gym.core import Wrapper\n","from pickle import dumps, loads\n","from collections import namedtuple\n","\n","# a container for get_result function below.

The theoretically optimal $C_p$ you can get from a max reward of the environment (max reward for CartPole is 200).\n","* Use using a different exploration strategy (bayesian UCB, for example)\n","* Expand not all but several random actions per `expand` call. See __the notes below__ for details.\n","\n","The goal is to find out what gives the optimal performance for `CartPole-v0` for different time budgets (i.e. different n_iter in plan_mcts.)\n","\n","Evaluate your results on `Acrobot-v1` - do the results change and if so, how can you explain it?\n","\n","\n","### Atari-RAM\n","\n","\"Build this\" assignment\n","\n","Apply MCTS to play Atari games. In particular, let's start with ```gym.make(\"MsPacman-ramDeterministic-v0\")```.\n","\n","This requires two things:\n","* Slightly modify WithSnapshots wrapper to work with atari.\n","\n"," * Atari has a special interface for snapshots:\n","   ```   \n","   snapshot = self.env.ale.cloneState()\n","   ...\n","   self.env.ale.restoreState(snapshot)\n","   ```\n"," * Try it on the env above to make sure it does what you told it to.\n"," \n","* Run MCTS on the game above. \n"," * Start with small tree size to speed-up computations\n"," * You will probably want to rollout for 10-100 steps (t_max) for starters\n"," * Consider using discounted rewards (see __notes at the end__)\n"," * Try a better rollout policy\n"," \n"," \n","### Integrate learning into planning\n","\n","Planning on each iteration is a costly thing to do. You can speed things up drastically if you train a classifier to predict which action will turn out to be best according to MCTS.\n","\n","To do so, just record which action did the MCTS agent take on each step and fit something to [state, mcts_optimal_action]\n","* You can also use optimal actions from discarded states to get more (dirty) samples. Just don't forget to fine-tune without them.\n","* It's also worth a try to use P(best_action|state) from your model to select best nodes in addition to UCB\n","* If your model is lightweight enough, try using it as a rollout policy.\n","\n","While CartPole is glorious enough, try expanding this to ```gym.make(\"MsPacmanDeterministic-v0\")```\n","* See previous section on how to wrap atari\n","\n","* Also consider what [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/) did in this area.\n","\n","### Integrate planning into learning \n","_(this will likely take long time, better consider this as side project when all other deadlines are met)_\n","\n","Incorporate planning into the agent architecture.

This can be implemented the same way you did in the POMDP assignment."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FGeSJLOmR3_q"},"source":["## Notes\n","\n","\n","#### Assumptions\n","\n","The full list of assumptions is:\n","\n","* __Finite number of actions__: we enumerate all actions in `expand`.\n","* __Episodic (finite) MDP__: while technically it works for infinite MDPs, we perform a rollout for $10^4$ steps. If you are knowingly infinite, please adjust `t_max` to something more reasonable.\n","* __Deterministic MDP__: `Node` represents the single outcome of taking `self.action` in `self.parent`, and does not support the situation where taking an action in a state may lead to different rewards and next states.\n","* __No discounted rewards__: we assume $\\gamma=1$. If that isn't the case, you only need to change two lines in `rollout()` and use `my_qvalue = self.immediate_reward + gamma * child_qvalue` for `propagate()`.\n","* __pickleable env__: won't work if e.g. your env is connected to a web-browser surfing the internet. For custom envs, you may need to modify get_snapshot/load_snapshot from `WithSnapshots`.\n","\n","#### On `get_best_leaf` and `expand` functions\n","\n","This MCTS implementation only selects leaf nodes for expansion.\n","This doesn't break things down because `expand` adds all possible actions. Hence, all non-leaf nodes are by design fully expanded and shouldn't be selected.\n","\n","If you want to only add a few random action on each expand, you will also have to modify `get_best_leaf` to consider returning non-leafs.\n","\n","#### Rollout policy\n","\n","We use a simple uniform policy for rollouts. This introduces a negative bias to good situations that can be messed up completely with random bad action. As a simple example, if you tend to rollout with uniform policy, you better don't use sharp knives and walk near cliffs.\n","\n","You can improve that by integrating a reinforcement _learning_ algorithm with a computationally light agent. You can even train this agent on optimal policy found by the tree search.\n","\n","#### Contributions\n","* Reusing some code from 5vision [solution for deephack.RL](https://github.com/5vision/uct_atari), code by Mikhail Pavlov\n","* Using some code from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/blole/dfebbec182e6b72ec16b66cc7e331110)\n","\n","#### References\n","* <a id=\"1\">[1]</a> _Coulom R.
